        The history of Guinness is intertwined with the creation and <br />
        development of the eponymous company, known for its famous stout beer. <br />
        Here's a brief overview of Guinness' history: It all began in 1759<br />
        when Arthur Guinness leased a small brewery in Dublin, Ireland. He<br />
        signed a 9,000-year lease and started brewing beer. Initially, <br />
        Guinness Brewery specialized in producing porter, a dark, rich, and<br />
        full-bodied beer. Over the first few decades, Guinness expanded and<br />
        grew, increasing its production capacity and solidifying its <br />
        reputation as a quality beer producer. In 1862, Arthur Guinness passed<br />
        away, and the management of the company was handed down to his son<br />
        Arthur Guinness II. In 1886, the Guinness trademark was registered<br />
        and from that moment, the beer became known as Guinness Stout. In the<br />
        early 20th century, Guinness became one of the most popular beer brands. <br/>

        Choose the right glass: Guinness is traditionally served in a pint <br />
        glass with a tulip shape, known as a Guinness pint glass. Make sure <br />
        the glass is clean and free from any residue or odors. Tilt the glass: <br />
        Hold the glass at a 45-degree angle and start pouring the Guinness <br />
        slowly. Aim the pour towards the back of the glass, allowing it to <br />
        slide down the side. Straighten the glass: Once the glass is about <br />
        three-quarters full, gradually straighten the glass as you continue to <br />
        pour. This technique helps create the signature creamy head. Let it <br />
        settle: After pouring, let the Guinness settle for a minute or two. <br />
        This allows the nitrogen bubbles to rise and creates the distinct <br />
        creamy head. Top it off: Once the beer has settled, top off the glass <br />
        by pouring a little more Guinness until the foam rises just above the <br />
        rim of the glass. Serve and enjoy: Place the glass on a coaster and <br />
        serve it to the customer. Guinness is best enjoyed at a leisurely pace <br />
        to fully appreciate its flavor and velvety texture. Remember, pouring <br />
        Guinness properly requires practice and patience. It's an art form <br />
        that aims to achieve the perfect balance between the dark beer and the <br />
        creamy head, resulting in a smooth and enjoyable drinking experience. <br />
